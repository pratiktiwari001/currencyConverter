# currencyConverter
A simple web-based Currency Converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates fetched from an API.

I have used FawazAhmed's API for getting real time currency conversion rates and flagsapi for getting Country's flag for better UI.
